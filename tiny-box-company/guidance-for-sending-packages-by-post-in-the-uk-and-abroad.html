	<h1>Guidance for Sending Letters, Parcels and Packages by Post in the UK and Abroad</h1>
	<p>When sending letters and packages to addresses within the UK and abroad there are often strict guidelines on how this can be done to avoid your items being denied shipping or from getting lost along the way. In the UK, the postal service is operated by the private sector and covers the mainland and most offshore land masses which are permanently inhabited.</p>
	<p>This vast network relies on public infrastructure, as well as huge fleets of delivery vehicles from cars and vans to lorries, ferries and even aeroplanes. Getting your important parcels to where they need to go, securely and on time, takes a lot of logistical planning at every stage of the process. For obvious reasons, communication is key when it comes to handling this national endeavour.</p>
	<p>In the 2020 fiscal year, Royal Mail handled an enormous 10 billion letters and 1.2 billion parcels within the UK. This mind boggling number does not account for the amount of mail bound for overseas locations, often within the EU and to American addresses. The postal and courier services of the UK is worth &pound;22.1 billion to the economy and employ more than 250,000 people.</p>
	<p>As our shopping habits move increasingly online, the postal and courier service industry is becoming more important than ever. Most of us will order items online for home delivery for convenience, but for others this option is a vital lifeline, granting them easy access to essential goods. Whatever you are planning to send in the post, make sure it is properly prepared for travel.</p>
	<h2>Securely packaging your items</h2>
	<p>The postal services often rely on automatic sorting which uses sensors and machines to assess the destination of the package or letter, and start it on its journey from the sorting office. Improperly packaged items can damage this hardware, and can lead to your parcel being discarded, for example, loose coins should not be sent in envelopes and should be properly secured to prevent damage to the item or the machinery.</p>
	<p>Fragile goods should be adequately protected from damage and should be wrapped in a protective covering such as tissue paper or bubble wrap, before being sized up for an appropriately sturdy box. Many post offices, high street shops and online retailers carry standardised <a href="https://www.tinyboxcompany.co.uk/postal-boxes"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>postal boxes</strong></em></span></a> which adhere to post office standards for mailing within the UK, and from the UK overseas. These are a great way to ensure the safe arrival of posted goods, but don&rsquo;t forget to weigh the item and the box together to get an accurate shipping cost.</p> <span style="display: block; text-align: center; clear: both;"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_GkDAKinu8?modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
	<h3>Controlled, restricted and prohibited items to send and receive in the UK</h3>
	<p>Some items cannot be sent via postal and courier services within and out of the UK, and this is to ensure that all goods entering and leaving a country are compliant with the relevant laws and regulations. This is to ensure the health and safety of postal workers, members of the public, and anyone who may come into contact with potentially dangerous goods. It may be surprising to learn that many common everyday items fall under the umbrella term of &lsquo;prohibited and restricted items.</p>
	<p>Everything from nail polish, perfume and aftershave, and pressurised gases such as aerosols are considered to be hazardous cargo under current transport legislation. Aerosols can be transported within the UK, but cannot be posted overseas - many goods such as aerosols can be transported if certain conditions are met, while others cannot be posted from the UK, internally or externally, under any circumstances.</p>
	<p>An example of goods and substances that can never be transported via mail in the UK include asbestos, controlled drugs and narcotics, counterfeit currency, explosives, and weapons. Each of the prohibited items has at one point or other been attempted to be shipped using inappropriate mailing services, and these instances can lead to serious risk to the health and safety of others.</p>
	<p>If you are planning to send a parcel nationally or internationally, it is your responsibility to ensure that whatever is being posted is being done so correctly, and the transport of such goods does not infringe national and international law. Always check the transport guidance of your goods before sending them.</p>
