	<h1>The Tradition of Concealing Gifts With Packaging</h1>
	<p>When you have spent time researching and seeking out the perfect gift to mark a special occasion, or just to show a friend or family member that they are loved, the last thing you want to do is fall at the final hurdle and not present your gift beautifully. An underwhelming-looking gift is sure to blend into the background especially when up against ones that have been lovingly presented and are a delight to the senses.</p>
	<p>To do a gift justice and ensure it stands out from the crowd, many people opt for flashy and expensive premade options. For a truly special gift once in a while this expense can be absolutely worth it, but when you are giving gifts often or are planning to package multiple gifts for an event, this can very quickly become much too costly to be feasible.</p>
	<p>In order to ensure your gifts always have a striking and appealing look, and that you do not break the bank when purchasing exquisite packaging, you can choose any number of creative ways to add those finishing touches to a gift. If you have experience in crafts, however minimal, you will easily be able to pick up some tips for creating gorgeous packaging at a reasonable cost.</p>
	<h2>Why do we conceal gifts with packaging?</h2>
	<p>In many cultures across the globe it is considered a tradition to use some form of packaging to conceal the contents of a gift right up to the moment the gift is opened by the recipient. Humans have been demonstrating their generosity or showing love and devotion through gift giving for centuries. From the seasonal exchange of gifts to mark a festival or holy day, to celebrating a birthday or anniversary, gift giving is a widespread cultural phenomenon which endures to this day.</p>
	<p>If anything, the gift industry is stronger than ever, and in the UK we spend a whopping &pound;33 billion per year on Christmas gifts alone. Christmas aside, many of us will spend an additional &pound;700 on gifts for other occasions. It&rsquo;s safe to say that as a culture, we love buying gifts for our friends and loved ones. It makes us feel good to bring a smile to a special person&rsquo;s face, and so is beneficial for the gifter and the recipient.</p>
	<p>By concealing the contents of a gift, we can add an extra layer of intrigue and enjoyment to the event. This ritual of presenting lovingly wrapped packages and exquisite <a href="https://www.tinyboxcompany.co.uk/gift-boxes"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>gift boxes</strong></em></span></a> promises to surprise and delight, and make for a memorable occasion. The packaging chosen for each gift must be carefully chosen to take into account the personality, preferences and the culture of the recipient as various colours and designs inspire different feelings in us.</p>
	<h3>Considering the cultural significance of colour in gift wrapping</h3>
	<p>While many cultures have different opinions on what colour and style of packaging should be used for various occasions, there are a few which are particularly relevant in the UK. This discussion of the cultural significance of colour is by no means exhaustive, and you should aim to do a little more research if you feel this is an important consideration for your circumstances.</p> <span style="display: block; text-align: center; clear: both;"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_GkDAKinu8?modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
	<h4>White</h4>
	<p>In most Western cultures, white signifies spiritual purity. It is the colour of choice for weddings, Christenings, and other religious events.</p>
	<h4>Black</h4>
	<p>While black packaging is trendy and modern, the colour is also closely tied to death rites such as funerals in the UK. Having said this, it can be appropriate for almost any occasion when it is &lsquo;lightened up&rsquo; with accent colours.</p>
	<h4>Pink</h4>
	<p>In the 19th Century, the colour pink became much more gendered and favoured for women and girls. When welcoming a new baby girl, pink gift wrap is a common site, though most parents will appreciate this touch, some modern parents prefer a less gendered look for their kids, so check first.</p>
	<h4>Blue</h4>
	<p>Much like pink, blue has become increasingly gendered and is used most often for gifts for boys and men. Gifts for baby boys will often be finished in shades of blue, however this is not a rule - after all, colours are for everyone.</p>
	<h4>Red</h4>
	<p>Centuries of Chinese tradition has placed a high importance on the colour red. This auspicious colour represents good health, wealth, and general good fortune and prosperity, and by wrapping gifts with it you are wishing the recipient all these good things. Gifts of money are traditionally exchanged within red envelopes which often feature ornate detailing, often in gold.</p>
