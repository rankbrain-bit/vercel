	<h1>How Can Science and Technology Help Crop Producers?</h1>
	<p>Food production has become a hot topic in recent years, with processes falling under increased scrutiny. Everything from livestock rearing to the ways fruits and vegetables are grown is subject to the attention of the media and focus groups, and this has a strong bearing on the way that food production processes are viewed. The inequality in global food production systems is a particular area of focus, and is an issue which is closely linked to climate change.</p>
	<p>A warming world is less suitable for the crops we grow for consumption, meaning that any crops grown traditionally and field planted are susceptible to damage from conditions which are either too hot, too humid, and too dry. As our climate changes, issues around food security become more apparent and poverty becomes more widespread. While the effects of climate change on crop production are just beginning to show in some parts of the world, others are already seeing worse outcomes every year.</p>
	<p>Changing climate conditions and a continuously growing global population are highlighting weaknesses in food systems which leave them vulnerable to collapse, making food security an ever more pressing challenge to be solved. Many feel that the best hope for overcoming the challenges posed by climate change and population growth lie in modern agricultural technology and alternative growing techniques.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, there is unlikely to be a single approach that will address these concerns; instead, the solution is likely to lie in the deployment of a range of technologies and new farming methods which will transform the ways we produce food and carry us into the future.</p>
	<h2>Transforming crop production through scientific development</h2>
	<p>In the past 50 years or so, we have made tremendous advances in the ways we farm and produce crop species. Highly targeted and effective pesticides are one of the earliest developments that have transformed crop production in recent years, making it possible to increase yields and reduce the amount of crop being ruined by insect damage.</p>
	<p>There are many kinds of pesticides and some are more controversial than others, having been banned by the EU and national governments. The development of pesticides is an ongoing process which remains highly contested. While trends for organically grown produce increase, the use of pesticides may become necessary as yields will need to match demands and organic growing methods are well known to produce smaller yields.</p>
	<p>Hydroponics are increasingly common in agriculture as they tend to achieve larger yields than field grown crops. The ability to manage a crop&rsquo;s growing environment within <a href="https://www.onestopgrowshop.co.uk/t/categories/grow-tents-and-sheeting/grow-tents"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>grow tents</strong></em></span></a> means that the crop is protected from bad weather and is less likely to suffer noticeable pest damage due to the lack of organic growth medium in hydroponic systems.</p>
	<p>Water use is another huge consideration for the growers of today, and this will only become more pressing with time. Climate change means less rainfall in already dry areas, so growing methods which use water efficiently are favoured. Hydroponics systems are very water conservative, so are a smart choice in these areas. Irrigating field grown crops uses water very inefficiently; much of the water evaporates from the soil surface before it can be taken up by root systems. The same can be said for spraying crops with commercial pesticides - there is a lot of waste involved. Hydroponics reduces the amount of water and fertilisers that are wasted, and dramatically reduces the need for pesticides.</p>
	<p>Commercial <a href="https://cole2.uconline.edu/eportfolios/109440/Home/Food_Security_and_the_Future">hydroponics systems</a> can largely be automated, with programmable lighting and water delivery to provide optimal growth conditions at every stage of the plants&rsquo; growth cycle. Having such a high level of control over the growhouse microclimate means that plant growth can be stimulated in such a way that reduces the time they take to mature. In effect, hydroponic growers can accelerate plant growth and can therefore produce multiple croppings in a single season.</p>
	<p>Genetic modification is a highly controversial approach to ensuring food security, and there are many arguments for and against its use. As it stands, many countries ban the use and development of genetically modified crops, but as pressures mount within food production systems, gene editing to produce crops which are resistant to the effects of climate change might become more acceptable.</p>
