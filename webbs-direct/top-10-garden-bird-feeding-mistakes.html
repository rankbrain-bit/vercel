	<h1>Top 10 Garden Bird Feeding Mistakes</h1>
	<p>Whether you are brand new to bird feeding, or you have been feeding your garden birds for years, we are going to discuss common mistakes that we all make and how we can avoid them going forward. We usually learn bird feeding by watching other people around us, this can lead to problems as we can pass down mistakes from limited knowledge. Read below to find out about some common mistakes.</p>
	<p>The first and most common mistake that we can make is letting our bird feeders go empty. Birds are attracted into your garden by sight, whether this is full feeders or a sparkling bird bath. If the bird feeders are empty birds will just fly past, they won&rsquo;t know that you are thinking of refilling at some point. As long as you continually keep them topped up the garden birds will remember that there is a constant supply of food and will come back daily to feed.</p>
	<p>Buying a cheap bird seed is also another mistake that we can often make. As the feed is cheaper, the ingredients in it get worse, you will find a lot of them have corn, oats, and/or wheat which won&rsquo;t be as tasty for the garden birds. This means that once they have tasted the food that is on offer in your bird feeder, if they don&rsquo;t like it then they won&rsquo;t come back and they will find another feeder in someone else&rsquo;s garden. When buying bird food it&rsquo;s important that you remember it should be as close to the food they would naturally eat as possible. Remember to store your bird seed correctly as it will also dry out and equally not be as tasty.</p>
	<p>When positioning your bird feeders or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.webbsdirect.co.uk/bird-tables/"><em><strong>bird tables in the UK</strong></em></a></span> garden, you need to ensure that they are protected. It&rsquo;s not just your birds that will want to eat the seeds that you are putting out, other animals will too, whether this is squirrels, cats, pigeons or rats. All of these will pose a threat to your garden birds, so either will hurt them or will deter them if the birds see them. Positioning your bird feeders or tables in a place that birds can easily escape, such as next to a bush or tree will make them feel safer and more inclined to eat.</p>
	<p>A mistake that could harm your birds and invite rodents into your garden would be not cleaning your feeders, baths and tables. It&rsquo;s extremely important to keep good hygiene in your garden. Dirty <a href="https://www.webbsdirect.co.uk/birdcare-wildlife-bird-feeders/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>wild bird feeders</strong></em></span></a> can get clogged, the food becomes damp and the bacteria will grow. If any birds then eat this it could really harm them. Not only this but a clean feeder and clean <a href="https://www.webbsdirect.co.uk/birdcare-wildlife-bird-baths/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>bird baths</strong></em></span></a> attract birds, there is nothing more attractive to your garden birds than cleaning glistening water.</p>
	<p>To appeal to the different species of birds that you get in your garden, you should also have different feeders. Having just one feeder will only take one type of bird food whereas when you have more than one you can feed birds for their specific needs. For example, bluebirds will want to eat mealworms but woodpeckers prefer suet feeders.</p>
	<p>Lastly, when we fill up our bird feeders, we would usually fill them to the top. This is a mistake that could be harming your birds or it may be the reason that they aren&rsquo;t coming as frequently as they once were. This is because when outside there is a chance that the food can get wet or will go off in the sun, if there is a lot of it, it will take longer to be eaten, meaning that it stays there for longer. If there isn&rsquo;t a full bird feeder and the seed gets damp, it should be ok as it will be eaten almost straight away and won&rsquo;t have time to fester.</p>
