	<h1>At Home Bike Trainer</h1>
	<p>Cycling is the activity of choice for all different kinds of people who are into health and fitness. From casual cyclists who just head out for a mild ride on the weekends to dedicated road bikers who commute by bike everyday, it is a great sport for people of all abilities and fitness levels. If you have not cycled for a long time, or have never ridden a bike, it can be hard to know where to start when you decide to take cycling up as a hobby.</p>
	<p>Luckily, online guides to choosing your new bike are common, so a quick search will return advice on choosing from all the latest models. There is one form of cycling that is perfect for getting in some extra cardio, and doesn&rsquo;t require you to learn to ride a bike. Spinning is done using stationary exercise bikes, meaning that you do not need to balance the bike while you pedal.</p>
	<p>Indoor cycling is different from outdoor cycling in a number of ways aside from the skills needed. Weather in the UK can put a lot of us off outdoor cycling, especially during the colder months when rain and winds can be harsh. Using indoor cycling as an alternative is a great way to make sure you are not missing out on your regular sessions, and it&rsquo;s also much more convenient than outdoor cycling, especially for people with busy lifestyles.</p>
	<p>Outdoor cycling, while hugely enjoyable, can make it hard to fit exercise in around things like work and childcare. Indoor cycling when done in the home is much more convenient for busy adults with an interest in keeping fit. You can make your workouts even more time efficient by using newly developed technology.</p>

	<p>As you exercise, your heart rate increases. The more intensely you exercise, the more it will increase. Studies into this effect have shown that your heart rate moves through several zones, depending on how hard you are working. Your resting heart rate is what you experience when you are still for a while, and this forms your baseline heart rate. When your heart is beating at its fastest during intense exercise, it will reach the cardio zone. This zone is what you want to aim for to gain the maximum benefits from your exercise sessions.</p>
	<p>Using your heart rate zones to make your workouts more effective can easily be done, even by beginner cyclists. An <a href="https://www.ciclozone.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>at home bike trainer</strong></em></span></a> app can be a very useful bit of kit and will help take your spinning sessions to the next level. Compatible with smartphones and watches, cycling apps monitor your progress so you can see how much further and faster you can cycle over time when compared with when you first started out.</p>
	<p>There are a few other things you can do to make your sessions more effective and comfortable that you should consider, especially if you are planning on cycling multiple times per week. One indoor cycling must-have is a decent leak-proof water bottle. Most exercise bikes come equipped with a bottle holder, and using a bottle with a sports cap means you don&rsquo;t have to break your pace in order to rehydrate.</p>
	<p>Something that road bikers swear by is padded cycling shorts. While they&rsquo;re not absolutely necessary for indoor cyclists, they can make those longer rides much more comfortable so you can push yourself to achieve new distance records. Suitable for men and women, the built in padding allows you to sit more comfortably and means you won&rsquo;t be distracted by discomfort while exercising.</p>
	<p>Using a small towel to wipe down the handlebars of your exercise bike when they get sweaty helps you to keep a firm grip, so keep one nearby for convenience. Many spinners also like to keep another towel close to keep sweat out of their eyes, but you can also buy sweatbands that are worn on the wrist or around the head and they will also do the trick while keeping your hands free.</p>
	<p>Remember to exercise safely and do not attempt to take on too much at once. If you are not used to regular exercise, take it slowly and build the intensity of your workouts gradually. It can be easy to injure yourself, so if you feel any sudden pain or undue discomfort then seek help immediately.
