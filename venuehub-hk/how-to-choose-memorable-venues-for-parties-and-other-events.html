	<h1>How to Choose Memorable Venues for Parties and Other Events</h1>
	<p>No matter what kind of event you are planning, the venue that you choose will have a strong impact on the thematic direction your party takes. Choosing a venue which matches the theme and style you want for your event goes a long way to creating the perfect atmosphere, ensuring that your party makes the best possible impression.</p>
	<p>The events industry provides a huge range of stunning venues which can be matched to suit the tone and type of event being held. They are usually quite versatile in how they can be styles, and offer a good amount of flexibility for event planners. Some venues are more suited to corporate events, and others are better for more personal events such as birthday parties and weddings. From Christenings to product launches, from weddings to business conventions, your chosen venue will help you to create the perfect party which is truly memorable.</p>
	<h2>Deciding on a venue size for your event</h2>
	<p>One of the first and most important things to think about when choosing a venue for a special occasion is making sure that it is the right size for the number of guests in attendance. In addition to being spacious enough to comfortably accommodate the total number of guests invited, the venue also needs to be large enough for any activities or entertainment you have planned such as a dance floor.</p>
	<p>A good example is wedding venues. They need to be large enough to have space for everyone in the wedding party but when the same venue is used for both the ceremony and reception, it needs to be big enough to accommodate the highest number of guests. They also need to have space for a DJ or band if they are planned as entertainment.</p>
	<p>Business events and other corporate conventions which have a largely seated audience, you can usually fit more people into a space, however, all venues have legally enforced capacity limits, and these should always be noted for the health and safety of your guests. If a venue is overloaded it can be dangerous, and it is also uncomfortable and can make your event an unpleasant place to be.</p>
	<p>When looking for <a href="https://www.venuehub.hk/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>venue hire</strong></em></span></a> for your event, you should aim to get as many quotes and as much information on the space as possible from suppliers. Having a shortlist is a good idea as you can whittle down your choices and focus on the ones that look most promising. Never be too rigid when choosing venues as things often don&rsquo;t go exactly to plan and you may end up relying on your second or even your third favourite option.</p>
	<p>If you end up choosing a venue which is too big for the number of guests you are planning to invite, it can give your event a cold and awkward atmosphere. A small number of guests in a large space makes the party look under-attended and can leave guests wondering when or if the other guests will arrive. A smaller guest list calls for a more intimate venue, so focus your research in this area. This will give your event the best possible start and will make sure your capacity needs are met.</p>

	<h2>Choose your event&rsquo;s theme carefully</h2>
	<p>A carefully chosen theme will really set your event apart from others held in the same year, making it more memorable to guests long after the cake and confetti have been cleared away. Choose a venue which matches the theme you are going with, so for rustic parties, think of country barns and country pubs. In doing so, you can tie in the exterior and interior decoration of a <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/venuehub-hk/ultimate-guide-to-planning-a-wedding.html">venue</a> beautifully and the event will not feel disjointed. The ideal venue should provide a complementary base for you to build on.</p>
	<h2>The trend for sustainable events</h2>
	<p>Sustainability is a strong trend in the events sector, and this is set to continue as eco friendly parties become more popular. Consider offering eco friendly party planning services as these resonate well with a modern client. Specialising in ethical, sustainable event planning is sure to be a valuable business model in the years to come as consumers and suppliers move with the times.</p>
