	<h1>Fascinating Facts About Cashmere Clothing</h1>
	<p>Almost everyone has heard of cashmere, whether they have owned it before or not, however not everyone knows where it comes from, how it is made, or how to care for it properly. As a material it is notoriously expensive and is considered a luxury option in clothing manufacture. It has a lot of unique properties which make it much more desirable than other natural wools, and it has a long and interesting history.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cashmere is known for being expensive. One of the main reasons why cashmere is so expensive is the fact that each cashmere goat only produces about 100g of wool every year, so it takes multiple animals to create a single garment. Goats only produce the right coat type to produce cashmere wool once per year, so output per animal is quite low. A single goat produces about enough wool for a pair of womens&rsquo; cashmere socks, and jumpers can take around 5 goats worth of wool to produce.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Cashmere is ancient. Cashmere has been produced for thousands of years in the Kashmir region spanning India and Pakistan. Cashmere goats were first bred here, and this is where, thousands of years ago, humans first began combing the animals to remove the ultra fine winter undercoat to spin into yarn.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Cashmere is produced around the world. Though the Kashmir region is still known as one of the world&rsquo;s major producers of cashmere, flocks of cashmere goats can be found all over the world. There are well established flocks of cashmere goats in Australia, America, the UK, and throughout Asia. Around 6,500 tons of raw cashmere is produced globally, which is used to create&nbsp;<a href="https://cashmereandcotton.co.uk/collections/cashmere-cardigans"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>pure cashmere jumpers</strong></em></span></a>&nbsp;and garments, or is combined with other natural or synthetic fibres to produce cashmere blends which are cheaper than garments made from pure cashmere.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Cashmere is highly practical. While pure cashmere jumpers might be highly luxurious and soft, they are also highly practical. Cashmere is very strong despite being fine and lightweight, and can retain its shape for years when cared for properly. It is an excellent choice of base layer for extremely cold weather conditions, and is even better than merino wool for this use. Though it does have some special care requirements, they are still very simple and easily achieved.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Cashmere has noble heritage. Though it has somewhat humble origins, noblemen of the Roman Empire wore cashmere as a status symbol as it was known to be more expensive and fine than other textiles. The popularity of cashmere and its place as a luxury good was cemented in the 1700s as trade made it more accessible to people of a high social status. At this time it became a favourite of European royalty and the aristocratic class. While cashmere retains its air of opulence, it is much more affordable these days which has contributed hugely to its popularity.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Cashmere is sustainable. The modern tendency to choose fast fashion rather than pieces which are meant to last. A&nbsp;<a href="https://cashmereandcotton.co.uk/collections/cashmere-cardigans"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>cashmere cardigan</strong></em></span></a>&nbsp;is likely to stand up to many wears over the course of years, whereas cheaper materials will quickly begin to lose their shape, pill, and become untidy looking. Choosing clothing which is made to last is much more environmentally friendly than choosing things which are only designed to be worn for a single season and then discarded.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Cashmere can be any colour. Natural, unprocessed cashmere comes in white, grey, and brown, though it is usually dyed to ensure a uniform finish. Lighter coloured or minimally processed cashmere yarns tend to be softer than yarns which have been intensely colour treated, but this difference in softness is only very slight and does not affect the quality of the garment. In order to minimise the amount of processing the yarn goes through, lighter wool is dyed with lighter pigments, and darker wool is colour treated with darker shades.</li>
