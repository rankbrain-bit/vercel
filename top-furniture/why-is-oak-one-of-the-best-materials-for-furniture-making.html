	<h1>Why Is Oak One of the Best Materials for Furniture Making?</h1>
	<p>Wood has long been the material of choice when it comes to furniture making. For centuries it was pretty much the only option other than stone, which is heavy and difficult to work with making it unsuitable for furniture. Early wooden furniture was simple and entirely practical with minimal decorative elements, and pieces were built to last. It wasn&rsquo;t uncommon for people to either make their furniture themselves or to have furniture handed down from older family members.</p>
	<p>In temperate parts of the world, oak has long been the favoured material for making furniture as it has many natural qualities which make it especially suited to this purpose. In fact, it is so well suited to furniture making and construction that many examples of oak fixtures and fittings made centuries ago can be found today.</p>
	<h2>What&rsquo;s so good about oak?</h2>
	<p>All woods are either hardwoods or softwoods, but this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that all softwoods are soft and all hardwoods are hard - it relates more to the way the trees reproduce. Generally speaking, however, most hardwoods do tend to be hard and dense while softwoods are usually lighter weight.</p>
	<p>Hardwoods tend to be slower growing than softwoods which allows them to create incredibly dense structures. As such, the grain of most hardwoods is tightly packed, meaning the resulting wood is strong and heavy. In oak, this effect is very pronounced, so timber made from oak is known for being tough and strong.</p>
	<p>There are more than 600 distinct species of oak grown around the world, but the most commonly used for making furniture for the home setting are white and red oak as these are some of the best to work with and most easily grown in temperate climates, particularly in the UK and USA. In the UK, English oak is more common than the other types.</p>
	<p>Aside from being dense and strong, oak also resists damage from external factors such as moisture, rot, and insects. This is again down to the densely packed grain as it doesn&rsquo;t easily allow for surface penetration, especially once the wood has been treated. The pores in white oak are sealed which make it especially resistant to water damage so it is often used to make outdoor furniture.</p>
	<p>Properly cured and surface treated oak lasts for years with a little care and attention, so though <a href="https://www.topfurniture.co.uk/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>oak furniture</strong></em></span></a> can be on the expensive side it can&rsquo;t be beaten in terms of quality and longevity. In addition to being a hard wearing and long lasting material, many cuts of oak are beautifully patterned with a distinct, attractive grain. Markings in oak are straight and uneven, giving every piece a unique look.</p>

	<h2>How to care for oak</h2>
	<p>Caring for oak is quite straightforward, and mostly comes down to common sense. Avoiding things that are known to be damaging to solid wood furniture increases its lifespan dramatically so it is very cost effective over time. The main risks to oak are light, heat, water, and insects.</p>
	<p>Avoid positioning wooden furniture close to any heat sources such as radiators and windows that let in strong sunlight. Heat sources dry wood out over time and can lead to cracking, so keep radiators turned down low when the room is not in use, and make sure windows stay covered as much as possible. Heat also affects how long the wood&rsquo;s surface treatment will last, so you may find that oak left too close to a heat source will start to look dry more quickly and will need recoating with oil or wax more often.</p>
	<p>While furniture made from oak is very strong, weaknesses can become apparent over time if the furniture is not properly handled. Swinging back on oak chairs causes the joints to weaken and leads to unsteady chairs that will need repairing or replacing before their time. Most chairs and <a href="https://canvas.yc.edu/eportfolios/15728/Home/How_to_Choose_the_Perfect_Dining_Table_Size">tables</a> will come with a maximum load capacity, so check this before you buy them and avoid exceeding the maximum.</p>
	<p>Chests of drawers made from oak will sometimes become stiff with age. If this happens and you are struggling to remove the drawers, parts of the unit may need sanding down and refinishing to refit them correctly.</p>
